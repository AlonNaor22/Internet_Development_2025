# GameStore Server Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the GameStore server-side application as described in the project documentation. The server provides functionality for managing games and users, with a focus on implementing the required architecture and components.

## Completed Components

### Data Model
- [x] Game.java - Represents a game in the game store
- [x] User.java - Represents a user in the game store system

### DAO Layer
- [x] IDao.java - Generic interface for data access
- [x] GameFileDao.java - Implementation of IDao for games using file persistence
- [x] UserFileDao.java - Implementation of IDao for users using file persistence

### Service Layer
- [x] GameService.java - Service that handles business logic related to games
- [x] UserService.java - Service that handles business logic related to users

### Controller Layer
- [x] Response.java - Represents a response from the server to the client
- [x] Request.java - Represents a request from the client to the server
- [x] UserController.java - Controller that handles user-related requests
- [x] GameController.java - Controller that handles game-related requests
- [x] ControllerFactory.java - Factory for creating appropriate controllers

### Networking
- [x] HandleRequest.java - Handles a single request from a client
- [x] Server.java - Manages the server and listens for requests
- [x] ServerDriver.java - Main class to run the server

### Project Configuration
- [x] pom.xml - Maven configuration file for the server side

## Integration with Algorithm Module
- [x] Added the algorithm-module-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar as a dependency
- [x] Prepared GameService for integration with string matching algorithms
- [x] Implemented a fallback search method until the JAR is properly integrated

## Features Implemented
- [x] User registration and authentication
- [x] User profile management
- [x] Game library management for users
- [x] Game catalog management
- [x] Game search functionality (using a simple fallback method)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete integration with the algorithm module for advanced search capabilities
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Implement client-side application with JavaFX UI
- [ ] Add more advanced features like game recommendations
- [ ] Enhance security features

## Notes
- The server uses file-based persistence for storing game and user data
- The server implements a multi-threaded architecture to handle multiple client connections
- The server uses JSON for communication with clients
- The server includes sample data initialization for testing purposes
